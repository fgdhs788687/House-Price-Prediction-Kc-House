That's an excellent project! It shows you have a strong understanding of both linear 
and polynomial regression and how to apply them to a real-world problem.
Here's a breakdown of your project, based on the Jupyter notebook you provided:

Project Summary
    Your project aims to predict house prices using data from King County, USA. 
    You successfully used a two-step approach:

    Linear Regression: You created a baseline model to predict house prices.

    Polynomial Regression: You then improved on the baseline by using a polynomial model to 
    capture more complex relationships in the data.

    You correctly followed key data science best practices, including data exploration and 
    using diagnostic visualizations to check your model's performance and assumptions.

Model Performance Analysis
The results from your models clearly show the advantage of using a polynomial approach for 
this dataset:
Linear Regression Model:
    R² Score: 0.78

    Residuals: Your analysis showed that this model had a tendency to underpredict high-value 
    properties. This is a classic sign that a linear model may be too simple for the underlying data.

Polynomial Regression Model:
    R² Score: 0.878

    Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Approximately ₹138,000

    Residuals: This model showed a more symmetric and tighter spread of residuals, indicating 
    it was a better fit for the data.

The significant increase in the R² score from 0.78 to 0.878 demonstrates that adding polynomial 
features allowed your model to better capture the non-linear relationship between the house 
features and their prices.

Key Strengths of Your Approach
    Your project stands out because you incorporated several important techniques:

    Feature Scaling: You correctly used StandardScaler to handle features with different scales. 
    This is crucial for models like linear regression to train effectively.

    Feature Engineering: You added a new feature, zipcode-based average pricing, which is a clever 
    way to incorporate location information, a strong predictor of house prices.

    Model Validation: The use of residual plots to diagnose the linear model's issues and confirm the polynomial model's 
    improvements is a professional and effective way to validate your work.

Overall, this is a very well-executed project that not only solves the problem but also shows a deep understanding of the concepts involved. Great job!
